## Mistakes I Made
For posterity, I note the mistakes I made during my attemps at TDD.

### Atempt 1
* Stopped at test for 9.
* Spend hours designing a soultion for test case 9 (over-engineering)
* Implemented a two pass (complex) solution for test case 4 instead of doing the simplest thing of introducing a new mapping
